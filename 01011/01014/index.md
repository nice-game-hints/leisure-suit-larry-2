title: Why am I 'attacked' by Mrs. Bimbo when I go back to my cabin?
---
# Hint 1
Blame it on the night, and the romance of the cruise. <g>

# Hint 2
Did you go into Mrs. Bimbo's room more than once before going out?

# Hint 3
Don't!  3 safe entrances to your room is all you get.

# Hint 4
And *never* come back to her room more that twice!
